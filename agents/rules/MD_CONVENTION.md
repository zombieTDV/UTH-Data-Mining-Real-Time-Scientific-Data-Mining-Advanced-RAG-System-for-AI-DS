# MD_CONVENTION.md — Markdown Formatting & Metadata Standard

- **Motivation/Background**: Project documentation across audits, phase specifications, bug reports, and experiment records requires consistent structure and strict temporal traceability to avoid confusion between current, stale, and superseded artifacts.
- **Purpose**: Define the mandatory 7-field header (including metadata and update timestamps), anchor/TOC rules, clickable cross-reference standards, and lifecycle conventions for all `.md` files.
- **Overview Pipeline**: Formulated during project consolidation refactoring and applied universally across all project documentation.
- **Detailed Plan**: §1 Required Header Specification; §2 Markdown Update-Timestamp Standard; §3 Document Lifecycle Statuses; §4 Mandatory Cross-Reference Links; §5 Conventions Table; §6 Self-Review Checklist.
- **References**: `agents/rules/CREATE_FOLDER_STRUCTURE_TEMPLATE.md`, `agents/rules/MD_CONVENTION.md`.
- **Created**: 2026-07-25T00:00:00+07:00
- **Last Updated**: 2026-09-06T20:55:00+07:00

## 1. Required Header Specification (7 Fields)

Every Markdown file created or updated in this repository MUST start with the standard 7-field header block in exact order:

```markdown
# <Title>

- **Motivation/Background**: 1–3 sentences — why this doc exists.
- **Purpose**: one sentence — what this doc achieves.
- **Overview Pipeline**: 1–2 sentences — the process that produced this content.
- **Detailed Plan**: compact list of sections/subsections and what each covers.
- **References**: comma-separated libraries/tools/frameworks/rules used.
- **Created**: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±HH:MM (ISO 8601 with explicit timezone offset)
- **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±HH:MM (ISO 8601 with explicit timezone offset)

```

## 2. Markdown Update-Timestamp Standard

### Exact Rules

1. **Format:** Standard ISO 8601 extended format with explicit timezone offset: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±HH:MM` (e.g. `2026-09-06T20:55:00+07:00`).
2. **Timezone Convention:** Use the local project timezone offset (e.g. `+07:00` or UTC `Z`). Never omit the timezone designator.
3. **Creation Timestamp (`Created`):** Set once when the file is created. Never modified afterwards.
4. **Update Timestamp (`Last Updated`):**
   - Must be updated **every time** the file is edited or touched by an agent or human.
   - Any agent performing modifications to a `.md` file is strictly required to refresh `Last Updated` to the current execution time.
5. **Handling Existing Markdown Files Without Timestamps:**
   - When an agent encounters an older `.md` file lacking timestamp fields, the agent **must not** blindly overwrite the file just to add timestamps.
   - However, when the agent is legitimately modifying or updating an existing `.md` file as part of a task, it **must backfill** both `Created` (estimated from git history or set to current timestamp) and `Last Updated` (current execution time).

## 3. Document Lifecycle Statuses

For documents that track plans, audits, bug fixes, or phase specifications, include a lifecycle badge or status line directly beneath the header:

- `[STATUS: DRAFT]` — Initial proposal under active creation.
- `[STATUS: ACTIVE]` — Current authoritative source of truth for implementation.
- `[STATUS: COMPLETED]` — Milestone, experiment, or task successfully completed and verified.
- `[STATUS: SUPERSEDED by <relative_link>]` — Retained for historical provenance, but replaced by a newer specification.
- `[STATUS: ARCHIVED]` — Preserved historical record, no longer maintained.

---

## 4. Mandatory Cross-Reference Links

- **Whenever a file, module, notebook, rule, or artifact path is mentioned in AI-generated Markdown, it MUST be a working cross-reference link** — never bare text. This prevents silent path rot and documentation drift.
- **Link Formats:**
  - Same tree / relative link: `src/training/train_model.py`, `notebooks/01_eda.ipynb`.
  - Section jumps: `agents/rules/LOGGING_CHECKPOINT_RULES.md#5-resume-procedure`.
  - External documentation: canonical URLs (`https://pytorch.org/docs/...`).
  - Canonical Model/Dataset Hubs: Direct markdown links to model repositories (e.g. Hugging Face [`distilbert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased)) or official dataset sites.

## 5. Conventions

| Rule | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Header Timestamps** | Mandatory `Created` and `Last Updated` in ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±HH:MM`). |
| **Single-variable principle** | One changed factor per experiment; explicitly state what is held constant. |
| **Cross-reference links** | Mandatory relative markdown links for all code, notebook, config, and doc paths. |
| **Output dirs** | `experiments/runs/<ts>_<run>/` (run state), `experiments/results/<experiment>/` (consolidated outputs). |
| **Notebook headers** | Follow `NOTEBOOK_HEADER_CONVENTION.md` including `## References` and timestamp. |
| **Results (5W1H)** | Every reported metric carries full 5W1H context per `RESULTS_REPORTING.md`. |
| **Separators** | `---` after header and between major sections. |

## 6. Self-Review Before Finalizing

- [ ] All 7 required header fields present (including `Created` and `Last Updated`).
- [ ] `Last Updated` timestamp refreshed to current time.
- [ ] Table of Contents anchors resolve cleanly.
- [ ] Every file, notebook, script, and directory mention is an active, working relative link.
- [ ] Document lifecycle status indicated if applicable (e.g. active vs superseded).
- [ ] No stale, hardcoded paths copied from other projects.
